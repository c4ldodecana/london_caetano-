            I'm lonely in London, London is lovely so</br>
            I cross the streets without fear</br>
            Everybody keeps the way clear</br>
            I know, I know no one here to say hello</br>
            I know they keep the way clear</br>
            I am lonely in London without fear</br>
            I'm wandering round and round here nowhere to go</br>
            While my eyes</br>
            Go looking for flying saucers in the sky</br>
            While my eyes</br>
            Go looking for flying saucers in the sky</br> </p> <br>

        <p class="um">Oh Sunday, Monday, autumn pass by me<br>
            And people hurry on so peacefully<br>
            A group approaches a policeman<br>
            He seems so pleased to please them<br>
            It's good at least to live and I agree<br>
            He seems so pleased at least,<br>
            And it's so good to live in peace and<br>
            Sunday, Monday, years and I agree<br>
            While my eyes<br>
            Go looking for flying saucers in the sky<br>
            While my eyes<br>
            Go looking for flying saucers in the sky <br></p> <br>

            Choose no way</br>
            I just happen to be here</br>
            And it's okay</br>
            Green grass, blue eyes, gray sky, God bless</br>
            Silent pain and happiness</br>
            I came around to say yes, and I say</br>
            Green grass, blue eyes, gray sky, God bless</br>
            Silent pain and happiness</br>
            I came around to say yes, and I say</br>
            But my eyes</br>
